Testing out GitHub repository functionalities
For some reason, I have main as the main branch and not master.

1. Create a branch (from branch selection)
2. Make the changes to the new branch - do not change the main branch
3. Go to Pull requests and click "New pull request".
4. Choose the correct direction: new branch to main.
5. Create the pull request and confirm it.
6. Merge the branch and then delete it once it is done.
